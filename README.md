                                                Electricity billing system
•	A one paragraph description of the overall project.
•	This project is a modern version of the traditional electricity billing system. The main focus of this Java project is to computerize the electricity billing system to make it more seamless, accessible, and efficient. The software calculates the units consumed within a specified time duration and accordingly calculates the amount of money to be paid for those units.

•	A one paragraph explanation of how the proposal is linked to the educational goals of this class and why this goal is an important goal (see list of subject in Initial Survey or slide 7 and 8 in CIS3296Introduction.pptx).
Unlike the conventional billing system, this computerized software does not require a large number of human employees to handle and manage the process of bill generation. Once it is installed on the system, it will automatically calculate the units consumed and the bills from time to time and also provide the meter readings to each customer. You can continue to add new features in the system as and when user requirements change.

•	A one paragraph description of your proposed contribution.
The following features make the electricity billing system more service-oriented and straightforward:
It features a high-performance speed along with accuracy.
It allows for seamless data sharing between the electricity office and customers.
It is protected by high-security measures and controls.
It includes the necessary provisions for debugging.
